INTRODUCTION





This guide provides an introduction to HP ProCurve Secure Access 700wl Series version 4 software for administrators familiar with version 3.1. It also provides a brief overview of the steps required to migrate a version 3.1 configuration to version 4. The topics in this chapter are:
What’s New in Version 4?	1-1
Upgrading from Version 3.1 to Version 4	1-4

What‘s New in Version 4?
The 700wl Series system software version 4 has a number of significant new features, including:
•	A new user interface that provides enhanced usability and improved workflow
•	A redesigned rights model that makes configuring authentication and access policy much easier
•	Centralized management of the elements of a 700wl Series system
•	Support for multiple administrators with different administrative roles
•	Support for redundant Access Control Servers and Access Control Server failover
•	Client-based bandwidth rate limiting
•	Enhanced VLAN support

New User Interface
The new user interface is a significant enhancement to the 700wl Series system. Functions are grouped in a more logical manner, workflow has been streamlined for common tasks; and the look and feel of the interface has been redesigned and made more consistent (see Figure 1-1).
The new Administrative Console has been designed based on extensive user experience with the 700wl Series system. It groups features and function together in a more process-oriented way. Common functions are easier to get to and common actions require going to fewer pages of the Administrative Console. For example, defining a “where” with the old Administrative Console takes 23 mouse clicks. With the new Administrative Console the same action (now known as defining a location) can take as few as 7 mouse clicks.
Chapter 2 “The New Administrative Console” surveys the new Administrative Console, showing where the features and functions of the old interface are now located, and briefly explains how to work with the new Administrative Console. After reading Chapter 2, you should be able to find your way around the new user interface to perform the functions familiar to you from version 3.1. The 700wl Series System Management and Configuration Guide provides a much more in-depth explanation of the features of version 4 of the 700wl Series system.
 
Introduction




Figure 1-1. The Old vs. the New Administrative Console

Old Interface	New Interface


New Rights Model for Authentication and Access
700wl Series system version 4 uses a new rights model that is streamlined, more logical, and much simpler to configure. The underlying concepts are familiar to users of 700wl Series system version 3.1, but the way rights are created and managed has been greatly simplified and terminology has been changed to be clearer.
The 700wl Series system uses a client’s Location (the Access Controller port through which it is connected), the currently applicable Time Window, and optionally, a VLAN tag, to match the client to a Connection Profile. The Connection Profile determines the Authentication Policy that is used to authenticate the client. The system also uses the client’s identity (user name or MAC address) to match the client to an Identity Profile. The combination of the Identity Profile and Connection Profile determines the Access Policy that is used to enforce access rights (the ability to pass traffic into the network) for the client.
Chapter 3, “The New Rights Manager” in this document provides a more detailed overview of the new Rights Management function. The 700wl Series System Management and Configuration Guide provides a a much more thorough discussion of using the new Rights Management features.

Centralized Configuration and Management
With the new Administrative Console you can configure, monitor and manage all the 700wl Series system equipment from one central Administrative Console accessed from the Access Control Server.
Information about Access Controller status and configuration is maintained on the Access Control Server, and is propagated to the Access Controller whenever configuration changes are made. You no longer need to go to the Administrative Console for each Access Controller to update the software, back up the system, or make any other configuration changes; in fact, the browser-based Administrative Console is no longer supported on an Access Controller.
The only configuration functions that must be performed on an Access Controller are those that enable the unit to be recognized on the network (setting the unit’s IP address, gateway, etc.) and to communicate with the Access Control Server (IP address and shared secret). These few commands are performed through the CLI when the unit is first installed on the network. Once an Access Controller is recognized
 
Introduction



by the Access Control Server, all configuration from then on is performed from the Access Control Server’s Administrative Console.
Because configuration information for all system components is maintained centrally, centralized management has the following implications:
•	The Administrative Console on the Access Controller is no longer accessible through a browser— providing the IP address of an Access Controller will display a page redirecting you to the Access Control Server.
•	Only a subset of CLI commands are available on an Access Controller—specifically those that enable network configuration, plus selected status commands. Commands that duplicate configuration functions that should be performed centrally will be disabled.
•	Backups are performed for the system as a whole, not individually for each Access Controller.
•	All logging is handled centrally. From the Administrative Console you can view the logs from any of the system components.
•	Client and session status from all Access Controller is displayed centrally—you can view all clients for the 700wl Series system as a whole (multiple system components) as well as for individual Access Controllers.

Access Control Server Redundancy and Failover
To provide high availability, 700wl Series system version 4 supports paired redundant Access Control Servers. One Access Control Server acts as the primary Access Control Server, managing the 700wl Series system. The other Access Control Server keeps a synchronized copy of the 700wl Series system configuration and database. Should the primary Access Control Server fail, or be unavailable due to a network failure, the secondary Access Control Server takes over. This is transparent to users, who continue to have their proper access and services.

Multiple Administrator Levels
The system administrator can create multiple administrator accounts. Version 4.1 allows three levels of administration, providing needed access to the Administrative Console without having to give all administrators full access.
•	Network Administrators can configure the network parameters that enable the 700wl Series system to function in a network, such as configuring IP addressing, interface configuration, date and time settings, SNMP access, and performing software updates and backups.
•	Policy Administrators can perform functions under the Rights Manager, such as adding and removing users, configuring Authentication, setting up Identity Profiles, Connection Profiles, and Access Policies, and manipulating the Rights Assignment Table.
•	Super Administrators can perform all the administrative functions for all connected components of a 700wl Series system—both network and rights configuration. In addition, a Super Administrator can add, delete, enable, and disable other administrator users.

Client-based Bandwidth Rate Limiting
700wl Series system version 4 provides the ability to limit the bandwidth available to each client to prevent network performance degradation. Using Access Policies, bandwidth can be limited on a client by client basis. Separate limits can be set for upstream and downstream bandwidth.
 
Introduction



Enhanced VLAN Support
700wl Series system version 4 provides enhanced support for VLAN tagging. In version 3.1, VLAN tags were maintained or added to data packets from the client. In version 4, when an Access Controller forwards a DHCP request for a client that is being VLAN tagged going upstream, the Access Controller now tags the DHCP request with the VLAN of the client. This allows you to have port subnets and VLANs with different DHCP servers. In addition, support for VLAN segregation has been added, so that clients in a VLAN only receive packets for that VLAN.

Improved System Logging and Log Analysis
All the system events that are logged are now entered into a unified log database. Instead of having to examining the log file for each Access Controller and for the Access Control Server, all the log information can be found in one place. The log file can be filtered by Access Controller or other criteria as appropriate to aid in monitoring or troubleshooting.

Remote Command Line Interface
Access to the Command Line Interface is now available remotely through an SSH client in addition to being accessible through the serial port. Each 700wl Series system component includes a new setting, Enable SSH command line interface, to allow access by this method. All CLI commands are available through this mechanism.

Expanded SNMP Support
700wl Series system version 4 introduces an additional set of Management Information Bases (MIBs) that can provide statistical and state information on the 700wl Series system. Third-party network management systems, such as HP OpenView, CA Unicenter, Concord NetHealth, etc. can query these MIBS via SNMP to provide real-time monitoring and reporting. In addition to the previously supported MIB-II - RFC 1213 and SNMPv2-MIB, version 4 has added:
•	New 64-bit counter support for high speed interfaces in IF MIB - RFC 2863
•	An HP Systems MIB that provides information on product type, software version, SNMP notifications, and environmental statistics
•	An HP-MEMPROC MIB that provides statistics about overall product load (both CPU and memory use)
700wl Series system version 4 has added a new SNMP trap:
•	A failover trap—If the secondary Access Control Server becomes the primary Access Control Server (failover) that Access Control Server issues a failover trap.

Upgrading from Version 3.1 to Version 4

Important: Upgrading from a version 3.1 to version 4 currently requires that you recreate some of your Rights configuration within the new Rights model.
 
Introduction



With previous releases of the 700wl Series system software, each new version was backwards-compatible; after the upgrade, the complete system configuration, including the Rights Manager configuration, was preserved and was still functional. The version 4 software is different in that it is not entirely backwards- compatible. In particular, the Rights Manager configuration is not entirely preserved upon an Access Control Server/Integrated Access Manager upgrade, and your rights configuration must be recreated under the new Rights model.
The basic building blocks—Wheres, Whens, Allows, Redirects, authentication services and the built-in user database—are migrated automatically during the upgrade, but groups, locations and Authentication Realms are not. You must create Identity Profiles, Connection Profiles, Access Policies and Authentication Policies that map the functionality of your 3.1 groups, locations and Authentication Realms.

Upgrade Requirements
HP ProCurve Access Control Server 740wl, Access Controller 720wl, and Integrated Access Manager 760wl units that are running software versions 3.1 can be upgraded to software version 4.
Because the software architecture has changed, you must upgrade all interconnected units to version 4— in other words, all Access Controllers connected to an Access Control Server or Integrated Access Manager running version 4 must be also upgraded to version 4.
See the Upgrading HP ProCurve 700wl Series Software Version 3 to Version 4 guide for detailed instructions on upgrading and migrating your 700wl Series system to software version 4.
 
Introduction

THE NEW ADMINISTRATIVE CONSOLE



This chapter introduces you to the new user interface for the 700wl Series system. It demonstrates how the new Administrative Console differs from the previous user interface and shows you where to find the proper pages for the system tasks you perform. The topics covered in this chapter include:
Connecting to the Administrative Console	2-1
Common Administrative Console Features	2-4
Main Menu Configuration Links (the Network Area)	2-11
Main Menu System Functions (the Maintenance Area)	2-21
Main Menu Wireless Data Privacy (the VPN Area)	2-25
Main Menu Views (the Status and Logs Areas)	2-29

Note:	When using the new Administrative Console, if you want further information on a particular page, consult the on-line documentation by clicking on the Help button (	) to get context-sensitive help for that page.

In many cases the contents of the new Administrative Console pages are similar to the old pages, so you should be able to use the much of the new interface immediately. The exception is the Rights Manager, which has been redesigned to make it simpler and more intuitive to use. See Chapter 3, “The New Rights Manager” for an explanation of how the new Rights Manager works.

Note:	In Version 4.0 you interact with all the components of the 700wl Series system through one Administrative Console that runs on your Integrated Access Manager or Access Control Server. You no longer need to connect directly to the Administrative Console of an Access Controller to configure, monitor or manage it. All configuration is done centrally from the Integrated Access Manager or Access Control Server Administrative Console. The 700wl Series system automatically propagates changes to the affected Access Controllers as appropriate.


Connecting to the Administrative Console
Logging on to the Administration Interface over the network is the same as for version 3.1:
Step 1. Set your browser to the IP address or hostname of your Integrated Access Manager or Access Control Server.
The Administrator Login page appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-1. Administrator Login page


Enter your administrator name and password. The default administrator username is “admin” and the default administrator password is “admin.”

Note:	Your browser must accept cookies to log in.

You should immediately change the administrator password and set the system date, time and time zone.
The initial Administrative Console page shows the status of the components of your system, as shown in Figure 2-2.
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-2. Initial Administrative Console Page


At the top of the page is the Header bar that displays information about this administrative session and the system it is running on, and a Navigation bar with icons for each of the main functional areas of the system. To go to one of these functional areas, click the appropriate icon.
To logout of the 700wl Series system, click on the logout button at the far right of the Navigation bar. Figure 2-3 shows the main menu page of the old Administrative Console and where the Logout button is now located on the Navigation bar of the new Administrative Console.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-3. Where to find the Help and Logout buttons


Figure 2-3 also shows where the Help button is now located on the Navigation bar of the new Administrative Console.

Common Administrative Console Features
The new Administrative Console uses a set of common visual features consistently throughout the entire interface. This section explains the meaning and use of these.

Common Page Layout Features
Figure 2-4 shows some of the common page layout features of the new Administrative Console:
•	Functional areas are organized into sections. Each section has its own tab at the top of every page for that functional area. These function tabs appear just under the Navigation bar. You move between sections of the functional area by clicking the appropriate tab. The currently active tab is shown in white. Tabs for other sections of the current functional area are greyed out. In Figure 2-4 the Equipment Status tab is the currently active tab, the others (Client Status and Session Status) are greyed out.
•	Functional areas with a lot of configuration options have sub-tabs. These sub-tabs appear near the top of the page (see the sub-tab in Figure 2-4 and the sub-tabs in Figure 2-5). These work the same as tabs.
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-4. Common Page Layout Features


•	On pages where you configure and manage the 700wl Series system components, those components are organized in a structured list that you create to match the organization of your network. You do this by creating folders and assigning equipment to a folder.
Folders are indicated by a folder icon (	) as shown in Figure 2-4. Folders can be opened to show
their contents or they can be closed to allow you to simplify or abbreviate the display.
Figure 2-5 shows additional common features of the Administrative Console:
•	On pages where you need to apply commands to specific HP ProCurve equipment, a concise version of the system components list appears on the left of the page. The folders in this list can be opened and closed to display the equipment. To configure or maintain a specific component, click on the component in the System Components List to select it. The selected component is highlighted and the page changes to display the current settings for that component. Any changes you make are applied to the selected component.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-5. More Common Page Layout Features


•	Most pages contain buttons for performing system configuration actions (see Action Buttons in Figure 2-5). For example, many pages have buttons at the bottom of the page for saving the current
settings, canceling any changes you may have started to make, or restoring the settings on the page to the default settings.
Three trailing dots (…) following the button label indicate that the button brings up a new page for performing the specified function, depending on the button label. Figure 2-6 on page 2-7 shows an example of this (the New Rights Assignment… button).

Note: In most cases when you click an action button on a page that has sub-tabs, the action applies to the contents of all the sub-tabs. For example, in Figure 2-5 clicking the Save button saves any changes that were made on the current sub-tab (Basic Setup) as well as any changes that were made on the other sub-tabs (Advanced Setup and SSL).
 
The New Administrative Console



Table and List Manipulation
Figure 2-6 shows common icons used for manipulating the items in a table or list.

Figure 2-6. Common Table Manipulation Icons (part 1)


•	Some items are managed by use of an ordered list. In the new Administrative Console you explicitly
order these lists by using the list ordering button to the left of the item in the list (	).
The list ordering button normally has two active parts. Click the up arrow to move the item up one position in the list; click the down arrow to move the item down one position in the list. If the item cannot be moved in a particular direction the arrow for that direction is grayed out.
Some built-in items have a fixed position in the list, such items have their list ordering button completely grayed out. For instance the Rights table has an “Any Identity/Any Connection/Unauthenticated Access” combination that is the “fall-through” or default match for clients that do not match any other profile; this is always at the bottom of the list.
•	To operate on items in a table or list, used the buttons on the right side of the row the item is in. Figure 2-5 shows the common buttons for editing an item (	) and for deleting an item (	).
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-7. Common Table Manipulation Icons (part 2)


Figure 2-7 shows additional features of the new Administrative Console:
•	In tables you edit an item in the table by clicking on that item. Row items that are links to the page for editing that item change color and are underlined when the cursor moves over the item name. The cursor also changes to show that the item is a link (for instance the mouse cursor changed to a pointing finger when it moved over Guest Access in the list of Access Policies in Figure 2-7).
•	On some pages you can toggle among different related functions or views of the system data. This is indicated by a set of links on the left of the page immediately under the page’s title. These navigation links are indicated by an arrow button ( ). Clicking on the link to the right of this button takes you to that page. The current page is grayed out in the list of related pages, see Navigation Links in Figure 2-7.
For example, in Figure 2-7 the current page is for configuring Access Policies (the Access Policies link is grayed out). From this page, by clicking the appropriate navigation links, you can go directly to various other pages to view and configure filters that may be used within an Access Policy.

Active Display Features
In the Status and Logs functions, on pages that display dynamic data, you can set the page to automatically refresh the data after a specified interval. To do this you select the desired refresh interval (or select Auto Refresh Off) and click the Apply Filters or Refresh button. The button is labelled Apply Filters on pages where the dynamic information can be filtered. See Refresh Setting in Figure 2-8 and the Refresh button in Figure 2-4.
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-8. Active Display Features


•	If a table contains more than 25 rows, the table is displayed in multiple pages with 25 rows per page. A set of page navigation controls are displayed below the bottom right corner of the table. You can navigate among the pages in two ways:
—	Use the forward (	) and backward (	) arrow buttons to view pages sequentially. Buttons are grayed out if you cannot move in that direction.
—	Select a page number from the drop-down list (   ) to go directly to a specific page.
You adjust the number of rows per page to display by selecting the number of rows to display on a page in the rows/page setting pulldown, see Rows/Page Setting in Figure 2-8. This setting is applied when you click Apply Filters. Any auto-refresh setting you select is also applied when you click Apply Filters.
•	Another way to control the display of information is provided by display filters. These are located on the left side of the page, see Display Filters in Figure 2-8. To filter the displayed information, select the desired filter values and click Apply Filters. This refreshes the display with data that matches the filter criteria.
•	In some tables you can sort the items in the table based on the table columns. Column headings that allow sorting appear as a link (change color and show as underlined) when the cursor moves over the
 
The New Administrative Console




column name (as shown in Figure 2-8). In some tables, such as the Log Files or Session Status display, where there are multiple items shown in a column, you may be able to sort on each item in the column separately (this is the case with the example in Figure 2-8).
Clicking the column heading sorts the table based on the alphabetical ordering of the items in that column. Clicking the first time sorts in ascending order; clicking a second time reverses the sort order. The column that is currently determining the display order is indicated by showing the heading cell in a darker grey. In Figure 2-8 the display is ordered based on the Protocol column.

Common Buttons and Icons
The following table lists the common buttons and icons used in the Administrative Console and gives their meaning.

Table 2-1. Administrative Console Buttons/Icons
Icon	Meaning

Folder: This represents a user-defined folder for system components. Folders can be opened, revealing their      contents, by clicking on the open folder icon (   ). They can be closed by clicking on the close folder icon (	).
See Figure 2-5 for an example of this icon. This icon is used in the System Components List.
Access Control Server, Integrated Access Manager or Access Controller: This represents a system component. These icons are used in the System Components List, and also on pages in the Network and Maintenance areas along with other identifying information (name or IP address) to identify the component that is being configured.
Secondary Access Control Server in a redundant configuration. This icon is used in the System Components List
Edit button: Click this button to edit the object in the same row. For example, to edit a Connection Profile in the Connection Profiles table.
Delete: Click this button to delete the object in the same row. For example, to delete an Access Controller from the System Components table.
List Ordering Button: These buttons appear in a list, such as Rights Assignment table, where the order of items in a list is significant. Click the top half of this button to move the current row up in the list; click on the bottom half to move it down in the list.
View: Click this button to view related information, for example, to view the login page associated with a Connection Profile on the Edit Connection Profile page. See Figure 2-23 for an example of this button.
Configure: Click this button to configure the object in the same row. For example clicking this button for an authentication service in the MAC Address Retrieval table brings up the Configure MAC Address Retrieval page for that authentication service. See Figure 2-23 for an example of this button.
Download: Click this button to download data from the source in the same row. For example clicking this button for an authentication service in the MAC Address Retrieval table downloads the MAC Address data from that authentication service. See Figure 2-23 for an example of this button.
Refresh Rights: Click this button to update the rights for the client in the same row. This applies the currently specified rights, and is normally done after the rights have been changed. See Figure 2-30 for an example of this button.
Logout: Click this button to logout the client in the same row. See Figure 2-30 for an example of this button.
 
The New Administrative Console



Main Menu Configuration Links (the Network Area)
The functional areas of the 700wl Series system have been reorganized in the new Administrative Console to improve the workflow. This and the following sections of this chapter show where to find the system tasks and functions in the new Administrative Console. With the exception of the Rights Manager, the information on most pages under the new Administrative Console is similar to the information that was on the corresponding page of the old Administrative Console.
This and the sections that follow are organized based on the 3.1 software user interface to help you find familiar tasks and functions.
Most of the functions that were under the Configuration link in the version 3.1 Administrative Console Main Menu are now found in the Network area of the new Administrative Console, accessed by clicking the NETWORK button on the Navigation bar of the new Administrative Console.

Figure 2-9. Where to find the Configuration functions


What‘s Changed
•	With the new Administrative Console you configure all the 700wl Series system equipment from one Administrative Console on the Access Control Server. You no longer have to go to the Administrative Console for each Access Controller; all the configuration and maintenance tasks can be done through the Administrative Console for the Access Control Server.
When system components are added to the 700wl Series system the primary Access Control Server will recognize them and automatically perform the initial configuration. All that needs to be set on an Access Controller before it is connected to the network is the IP address of the Access Control Server and the Access Control Server’s shared secret, so that the Access Control Server can recognize it as a trusted Access Controller.
 
The New Administrative Console




•	You can now configure redundant peer Access Control Servers to ensure high availability. A redundant peer Access Control Server takes over administration of the 700wl Series system automatically if the primary Access Control Server can no longer function.
•	The functions found on the old Admin Authorization page, including changing the administrator logon name and password and enabling technical support access, are now configured with the other configuration information, under the System Components tab of the Network module.
•	The specification of session logging has been expanded and moved to the logs area. To specify session logging go to the Logging Setup tab of the Logs areas. See “Logging Setup” on page 2-36.
•	Specify Location Information is now incorporated into the configuration of an Access Controller, and is handled under the new Rights Manager when setting up Connection Profiles.
•	Specifying an HTTP Proxy server for an Access Controller is now part of the configuration of the Access Controller.
•	The port configuration functions found on the Advanced Network Configuration page in the 3.1 Administrative Console are now found under the Interfaces tab in the Network area.

The System Components Tab
The system components area is where you specify the identity of your 700wl Series system components. The system components may be organized logically by placing them in folders.
»	Click the System Components tab in the Network area, as shown in Figure 2-10.
This brings up the System Components page.

Figure 2-10. The Network Area: System Components


»	To edit a component or Folder, click its name or the pencil icon at the right.
»	To delete an component or Folder, click the trash can button. A Folder must be empty to be deleted.
 
The New Administrative Console



Editing the Access Control Server
If you select an Access Control Server to edit, the Edit Access Control Server page appears. See Figure 2-11. On this page you can:
•	Give a name to the Access Control Server
•	Change the currently used shared secret. This change will be propagated automatically to all the currently active Access Controllers.
•	Change the Administrator Username and Password
•	Enable technical support access to the Access Control Server (if appropriate)
•	Enable an SSH command line interface to the Access Control Server (a new feature)
•	Configure a peer Access Control Server to act as a redundant Access Control Server, and specify whether this Access Control Server should be considered the primary Access Control Server if there is contention between the two peers.
See the HP ProCurve Secure Access 700wl Series Management and Configuration Guide for details of the new features.

An Access Controller appears in the System Components List as soon as it is installed on the network and configured with the correct Access Control Server IP address and shared secret.
If you select an Access Controller to edit, the Edit Access Controller page appears. See Figure 2-12. On this page you can:
•	Give a name to the Access Controller
•	Provide an optional description or NAS-ID (for use with RADIUS accounting)
•	Place the Access Controller into a folder
•	Enable technical support access to the Access Controller (if appropriate)
•	Enable an SSH command line interface to the Access Controller (a new feature)
 
The New Administrative Console



•	Change the Access Control Server IP address and shared secret, to disconnect the Access Controller from its current Access Control Server and connect it to a different Access Control Server

Figure 2-12. The Network Area: Edit Access Controller



The Network Setup Tab
The Network Setup area is where you specify the network settings for your 700wl Series system components. These vary depending on whether you are configuring an Access Control Server or an Access Controller.
»	Click the System Components tab in the Network area, see Figure 2-13.
This displays the Network Setup page. Initially, this displays the setting for the Access Control Server on which you are running the Administrative Console. For an Access Control Server there are three sub-tabs:
•	Basic Setup—This is where you specify how the IP address is assigned, the hostname (optional), the subnet mask, the gateway, and the primary and secondary DNS and WINS.
 
The New Administrative Console




•	Advanced Setup—This is where you configure the internal DHCP server settings used to provide addresses for NAT'ed clients.
•	SSL—This is where you generate CSR requests and load SSL certificates and private keys.

Figure 2-13. The Network Area: Network Setup for an Access Control Server


Access Controller
»	To configure the network settings for an Access Controller, click on the Access Controller from the system component list in the left panel of any Network Setup page.
The Network Setup page for that Access Controller appears. The initial sub-tab is similar to that for an Access Control Server.
For an Access Controller there are three sub-tabs:
•	Basic Setup—This is where you specify how the IP address is assigned, the hostname (optional), the subnet mask, the gateway, and the primary and secondary DNS and WINS.
 
The New Administrative Console



•	Advanced Setup—This is where you configure the bridging configuration, client polling (how long to wait for non-responsive clients), and whether to forward IP broadcasts to clients on specified ports. See Figure 2-14.
•	HTTP Proxy—This is where you specify the server IP address and port for any HTTP proxy used by this Access Controller.

Figure 2-14. The Network Area: Network Setup for an Access Controller

 
The New Administrative Console



The Interfaces Tab
Port settings for Access Controllers and Integrated Access Managers are no longer part of the advanced setup page. Port settings are now located under the Interfaces tab under the Network area. To view and configure port settings, click NETWORK, then the Interfaces tab. The Interfaces page appears, as in
Figure 2-15.

Figure 2-15. The Network Area: Interfaces: Speed/Duplex Tab


Click the appropriate component from the System Components List in the left panel. The page displays again with the interface information for that component. The port settings are divided across two sub- tabs.
•	The Speed/Duplex tab is where you set the connection speed and duplex setting for each port.
•	The Subnet tab is where you set the Port Subnet IP Address and Port Subnet Netmask for each port. See Figure 2-16.
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-16. The Network area: Interfaces: Subnet Tab


The settings on these two pages are very similar to the port settings under the Advanced Network Configuration page in the old (3.1) user interface.

The SNMP Tab
To configure the SNMP settings so that the 700wl Series system can be monitored by a network management system, click the SNMP tab in the Network area. The SNMP page appears, see Figure 2-17.
The settings on this page are basically the same as on the SNMP page in the 3.1 Administrative Console. Enter the appropriate information and click Save.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-17. The Network Area: SNMP



The Date and Time Tab
To set the time, time zone, and date for a 700wl Series system component, click the Date & Time tab under NETWORK (see Figure 2-18). In the System Components List in the left panel select the component for which you wish to set the date and time. The page displays again with the current date and time information for that component.
On the Date & Time tab you can:
»	Set the component’s time zone
»	Specify whether you want the time to be set and maintained by a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server, and specify the IP address for the primary and secondary NTP server.
»	Manually specify the date and time. Note that you can set the date and time manually and also configure an NTP server to maintain the time. (Setting the time manually can be useful when making large time adjustments.)
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-18. The Network Area: Date & Time



Main Menu System Functions (the Maintenance Area)
The actions that were under System Functions on the Main Menu of the 700wl Series system 3.1 Administrative Console are now found under the Maintenance area (the MAINT button), as shown in Figure 2-19.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-19. Where to Find the System Function Pages


Click MAINT to go to the Maintenance area. Figure 2-20 shows the Software Setup tab, which is the initial page that is displayed in the Maintenance area.

Figure 2-20. The Maintenance Area: Software Setup Tab


In the Maintenance area you can do the following:
•	Update the system software for 700wl Series system
 
The New Administrative Console



•	Backup and restore the 700wl Series system settings, logs, and rights (the 700wl Series system database). This backs up the configuration of the Access Control Server (or Integrated Access Manager) and all connected Access Controllers.
•	Shutdown and restart 700wl Series system components.

What‘s Changed
•	With the new Administrative Console you can perform these system functions on all Access Controllers and a peer Access Control Server from a single centralized interface on the Access Control Server or Integrated Access Manager. To manage a specific component, select the component from the System Components List in the left panel. The right panel changes to reflect the current settings for that component. Any changes you make and save apply to that component.
•	It is no longer necessary to back up or restore your Access Controllers individually. Since Access Controller configuration is done and stored centrally, Access Controller configuration data is backed up along with the Access Control Server configuration information. If you reset an Access Controller to factory defaults, once it reconnects to the Access Control Server (after configuring the Access Control Server IP address and shared secret) the Access Controller configuration will be propagated to the Access Controller by the Access Control Server.
•	The Distribute Logons option is no longer necessary. Logon processing is always distributed, i.e., logons are handled by the Access Controllers, not the Access Control Server. This greatly enhances logon performance.
•	“Update Software” is now labelled “Software Setup”
•	“Shutdown” is now “Shutdown/Restart”

The Software Setup Tab
To update the 700wl Series system software on any 700wl Series system component managed by this Access Control Server, click the Software Setup tab under the Maintenance area (see Figure 2-20.) In the System Components List in the left panel select the component for which you wish to update or check the installed software. The page displays again with the Software Setup information for that component.
The Software Setup tab summarizes the installed and alternate software versions for the selected component. From this tab you can:
•	Reboot to the alternate version of the system software.
•	Update the system software.
The update process is the same as with 700wl Series system 3.1.
Each Access Control Server and Access Controller can maintain two versions of the system software. You can reboot the system either to upgrade the system software or return it to the previous version of the software.

The Backup and Restore Tab
To backup or restore the 700wl Series system settings, logs, and rights data, click the Backup & Restore tab under the maintenance area. See Figure 2-21.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-21. The Maintenance Area: Backup & Restore Tab


Backing up the 700wl Series system database works the same as with version 3.1—first, you create the backup image, then you save the image to a file on your system’s hard disk. However, unlike version 3.1, the configuration for the Access Control Server or Integrated Access Manager and all connected Access Controllers is backed up in one operation.
To backup or restore your 700wl Series system, click the Backup & Restore tab. The backup is always made from the database on the Access Control Server that you are currently logged into as Administrator.
»	Click Create Backup Now to create a backup of the system settings, logs, and rights. This is stored internally on your Access Control Server or Integrated Access Manager.
»	Click Save Backup As … on the Backup and Restore page to download the backup image to a local directory.
»	To restore a previously saved system backup, click the Browse button under Restore Backup File to find and select the saved backup file, then click Restore Backup Now.

The Shutdown/Restart Tab
To shutdown or restart any 700wl Series system component, click the Shutdown/Restart tab under the Maintenance area (see Figure 2-22).
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-22. The Maintenance Area: Shutdown/Restart Tab


Select the target component from the System Components List in the left panel. The page displays again with the Shutdown/Restart information for that component.
As with version 3.1, you can choose to reboot the unit (Restart Now), shut down a unit (Shutdown Now) or reset the unit to its Factory Defaults (Reset Now).

Main Menu Wireless Data Privacy (the VPN Area)
The functions that were under Wireless Data Privacy Setup in the old Administrative Console have been placed in the VPN area. See Figure 2-23.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-23. Where to find the Wireless Data Privacy Setup pages


What‘s Changed
•	The IPSec, PPTP and L2TP, and SSH configuration pages have been combined into a single page, the Wireless Data Privacy tab under the VPN area.
•	In version 4.0, IPSec is enabled automatically when you enable L2TP.
•	The Certificate installation process for IPSec has its own tab under the VPN area.

The Wireless Data Privacy Tab
When you click VPN, the Wireless Data Privacy tab is displayed. Under the Wireless Data Privacy tab, you can globally enable or disable the security protocols—L2TP plus IPSec, IPSec alone, PPTP, and/or SSH. Figure 2-24 shows the Wireless Data Privacy tab.
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-24. VPN: the Wireless Data Privacy Setup Tab


The configuration settings for IPSec (IKE and ESP authentication and encryption) are the same as in version 3.1. See the 700wl Series System Management and Configuration Guide for a detailed explanation.
Once you have enabled the appropriate security protocols, you can specify whether those protocols are allowed or required as part of an Access Policy. In version 3.1 these settings were configured per Location. See Chapter 3, “The New Rights Manager” for more details on setting up Access Policies.
If you want to use a public key certificate for IPSec, you generate the certificate signing request (CSR) on the Certificates tab of the VPN area. When you receive the certificate from the certificate authority you load it into the system on this same page.

The Certificates Tab
The Certificates tab (shown in Figure 2-25) lets you generate a Certificate Signing Request, and load the resulting certificates into the 700wl Series system. This page is very similar to the IPSec Certificate Configuration page accessed using the Configure Certificate button from the IPSec Configuration page in the 3.1 Administrative Console.
 
The New Administrative Console




Figure 2-25. VPN: The Certificates Tab


See the HP ProCurve Secure Access 700wl Series Management and Configuration Guide for more details on configuring certificates for IPSec.

The IP Address Assignment Tab (Tunneling)
If you plan to use IPSec or PPTP/L2TP for Wireless Data Privacy, you must configure the method by which your Access Controller assigns the inner tunnel address used by a client using one of the tunneled security protocols. As with version 3.1, a different tunneling method can be configured per Access Controller. Figure 2-26 shows the IP Address Assignment page—it is basically the same as the Tunneling configuration page in version 3.1.
 
The New Administrative Console



Figure 2-26. VPN: IP Address Assignment



Main Menu Views (the Status and Logs Areas)
The functions that were under “Views” in 700wl Series system 3.1 are now split between the Status area and the Logs area. Figure 2-27 shows where the STATUS and LOGS buttons are located on the Navigation bar of the new Administrative Console. Click STATUS to go to the Status area (see Figure 2-28). This is also the initial page you see when you logon to the Administrative Console of the 700wl Series system. Click LOGS to go to the Logs area (see Figure 2-33).

Figure 2-27. Where to find the Views pages

 
The New Administrative Console



What‘s Changed
All the functionality available under the View heading in 700wl Series system 3.1 is still available. Changes have been made to make system monitoring easier:
•	With the new Administrative Console you can view the status and logs for all the 700wl Series system equipment from one Administrative Console located on the primary Access Control Server. You no longer have to go to the Administrative Console for each Access Controller.
•	All status information is accessible from the Status area. This includes both the Views section of the old
Main Menu and client status information that was previously found under the Rights Manager.
•	The Status views have been redesigned and enhanced to make them more readable and easier to manage.
•	All the log information, including the information found in the Rights Manager log in version 3.1, has been combined and is accessible from the Logs area.

The Status Area
With the exception of the Log Files page, the functions under the Views area of the old Administrative Console are available under the Status area of the new Administrative Console.

THE NEW RIGHTS MANAGER





This chapter will familiarize you with the new model for user rights in the 700wl Series system. This model is based on the previous model with which you are familiar, but has been changed to make it more intuitive and easier to manage. There have been changes in terminology, considerable changes in how you set up and manage rights (to streamline your workflow), and some changes in functionality. Read this section carefully before you start to migrate your current system to the new version.
The topics covered in this chapter include:
The Rights Manager	3-1
Access Rights in the 700wl Series system	3-8
The New Rights Manager	3-10
Configuring Access Rights—An Overview	3-10
Rights Manager Changes in Version 4: Summary	3-17
For a more detailed explanation of how access rights and authentication works in the new system, see chapters 4 and 5 of the HP ProCurve Secure Access 700wl Series Management and Configuration Guide. While working with the system, if you need further information on a particular part of the Rights Manager,
consult the on-line documentation by clicking on the help icon (  ) on the Administrative Console’s Navigation bar to get context-sensitive help for the screen with which you are working.

The Rights Manager
The Rights Manager has been completely redesigned for version 4. However, most of the basic building block for specifying rights have not changed, although their names may have changed:
•	Wheres—This concept has not changed, but they have been renamed Locations. Version 3.1 Wheres are automatically converted into Locations in version 4.
•	Whens—This concept has not changed, but they have been renamed Time Windows. Version 3.1 Whens
are automatically converted into Time Windows in version 4.
•	Allows (both system and user-defined)—This concept has not changed. Allows are preserved during the migration process to version 4.
•	Redirects (both system and user-defined)—This concept has not changed. Redirects are preserved during the migration process to version 4.
•	Authentication Realms—This concept has not changed, but these have been renamed Authentication Policies. They are preserved during the migration process to version 4.
•	Authentication Services—These have not changed. They are preserved during the migration process to version 4.
 
The New Rights Manager




•	The built-in database—This concept has not changed. There is a new category, Network Equipment, for devices such as Access Point, switches and the like that may appear as clients but should be handled differently in terms of authentication and rights. User entries in the built-in database are preserved during the migration process to version 4 (clients of type Access Point appear in the new Network Equipment category).
•	HTTP Proxy Filters—The concept has not changed, but HTTP Proxy filters are NOT migrated automatically to version 4. If you use HTTP proxy filtering, you will need to recreate your proxy filter specifications under version 4.
•	Customized Logon pages—The concept has not changed, but these pages are NOT migrated automatically. They must be recreated and linked to the appropriate Connection Profiles.
Beyond this, the way rights are handled in version 4 is quite different from version 3.1. The new rights model is conceptually much simpler and more straightforward to configure than in version 3.1. However, the higher-level rights information—the new 4 counterparts to 3.1 Groups and Locations with their various settings—must be recreated for version 4.

What‘s Changed
The old Groups and Locations from version 3.1 are not migrated to version 4 when the system software is upgraded. Instead, you must create Identity Profiles, Connection Profiles and Access Policies that map the functionality of your 3.1 Groups and Locations:
•	The function of Groups as a collection of users has been replaced by Identity Profiles
•	The function of Groups as the definition/specification of access control has been replaced by Access Policies
•	3.1 Locations have been replaced by Connection Profiles
•	Authentication Realms have been migrated to Authentication Policies, which are in turn linked to Connection Profiles
•	The method by which precedence was determined for Redirect filter evaluation has changed. In version 3.1, Redirects (and Allows) were evaluated based on the alphabetical ordering of their names. Thus naming was important to ensure that Redirects were evaluated in the correct order. In the new version, you can explicitly reorder the evaluation of Redirect filters by changing their position in the Redirect filters list. You can name them anything you want.
•	Customized logon pages are now linked to Connection Profiles. They must be recreated in version 4.
•	The process for determining what rights apply to a client at any given time is quite different.
•	HTTP Proxy Filter settings are not preserved after an upgrade to 4. You must recreate your filter specifications. HTTP proxy filtering is now configured as part of an Access Policy.

New Rights Manager Concepts and Terminology
The following sections define the key new concepts of the new Rights model implemented in version 4.
Connection Profiles
In the old Rights Manager, a Location was a combination of a set of “Wheres” that specified a physical location or set of locations defined as Access Controller ports. The Location also included other attributes that are not logically connected with the common idea of a location, including:
 
The New Rights Manager



•	A set of “Whens” to control when access is allowed through the Location.
•	A set of “Groups” to control who is allowed access through the Location.
The old Location concept also included settings for whether client addresses should be NAT’ed, and whether VLAN tags should be added to packets entering through the location. In addition, security settings (whether to require encryption) were based on the Location.
The new Rights Manager introduces the Connection Profile to replace the old concept of Location. A Connection Profile is used to classify clients based on the characteristics of how they connect to the network. Like a version 3.1 Location, a Connection Profile specifies both the physical entry point (a Location as a set of Access Controller ports) and the time (Time Window) of the connection. In addition, it allows you to specify a VLAN tag as a further characteristic of the Connection Profile. When a client connects to the network, that client is associated with a Connection Profile based on whether it matches the Connection Profile characteristics in terms of Access Controller ports, time of day, and VLAN tag, if any.
The Connection Profile has two uses:
•	The Connection Profile specifies how a user is authenticated when they connect to the system. Each Connection Profile is associated with a Authentication Policy (an ordered set of Authentication Services). Authentication Policies are equivalent to Authentication Realms in a version 3.1 system, except that they can also include NT Domain Logon and 802.1x Logon as “services” rather than using a whole separate configuration scheme to specify those authentication methods.
•	The Connection Profile is used, along with the Identity Profile, to determine the Access Policy that applies to the client, where the Access Policy defines the set of access rights granted to the client.
Where in version 3.1 the Location determined what encryption protocols were allowed or required, and whether NAT would be required, in version 4 these are determined by the Access Policy that applies to the client, which is determined by the combination of Connection Profile and Identity Profile that a client matches.
Identity Profiles
In the old Rights Manager a Group was the combination of a set of clients (users or access points) plus a set of access rights for that set of clients. The group also included a set of “whens”, so that “whens” appear both as part of a location (where they constrain when a connection can be made) and as part of a group (where they constrain when the group’s set of rights are valid).
This made the group concept confusing since it combined the normal idea of a group (a set of clients) with the Access Policy for the members of that group, and a time window. This was further complicated by the idea of a group type (Guest, Logon, Implicit User, Normal, Access Point, and Stop). The group types mapped onto basic sets of access rights.
The new Rights Manager replaces the concept of a group with two new terms—Identity Profile and Access Policy. This allows the separation of the who part of a group (the set of clients) from the what part (what the users are allowed to do on the network). Making this separation allows the Rights Manager to dispense with the group type.
There are no time windows in an Identity Profile. An Identity Profile is simply a set of clients. These can be users who log onto the system or access points. Access points are now called Network Equipment.
These changes in concepts and terminology are summarized in Figure 3-1.

»	To export or import rights click the Import/Export Rights link in the left panel of the Simulate User Rights page. See Figure 3-9.

Access Rights in the 700wl Series system
The 700wl Series system allows network administrators to define highly flexible access control policies that grant network access to a client based on who the client is, where they connect to the 700wl Series system, and the time of day when they make the connection.
The 700wl Series system uses a client’s identity (user name or MAC address) to match the client to an Identity Profile. It uses the client’s location (the Access Controller port through which the client is connected), the current time, and optionally, a VLAN tag, to match the client to a Connection Profile. The combination of the Identity Profile and Connection Profile determines the Access Policy that is used to enforce access rights (the ability to pass traffic into the network) for the client.
Access rights are implemented in the 700wl Series system through the Rights Assignment table. Each row in the table consists of an Identity Profile, a Connection Profile, and an Access Policy (see Figure 3-10).
 
The New Rights Manager



Figure 3-10. Rights Assignment Table


When a client connects to the 700wl Series system, the Rights Manager searches the Rights Assignment table from the top down until it matches the client to both an Identity Profile and a Connection Profile. The Access Policy associated with the matching row determines the access rights that are granted to that client.
A client may be associated with several different Identity Profiles (and possibly different Connection Profiles) during the life of its connection to the 700wl Series system. Each time the client’s identity, as known to the system, or location changes, the Rights Manager matches the client to an Identity Profile and to a Connection Profile, and then searches the Rights Assignment table to determine the Access Policy appropriate for that combination of Identity Profile and Connection Profile.
For example, when a client first connects to the system, it typically does not match any of the explicit Identity Profiles. However, the client always will match the built-in Identity Profile called Any. All clients, by definition are members of the Any Identity Profile. Similarly, all clients will match the built-in Connection Profile called Any, even if they do not match any of the explicit Connection Profiles.
When the Rights Manager searches the Rights Assignment table, the search falls through to one of the bottom rows in the table where the new client matches on the “Any” Identity Profile. The Any Identity Profile is typically associated with the “Unauthenticated” Access Policy, which grants rights that allow the client to log on and attempt authentication. (See chapter 5 of the 700wl Series system Management and Configuration Guide for a complete discussion of how authentication is handled.)
With a successful logon and authentication, the client has a new identity (its user name, and in some cases a group or domain affiliation) and now matches an explicit Identity Profile (for example, the “Authenticated” profile). The client is granted a new set of rights based on the Access Policy in the row that matches the client’s new Identity Profile and Connection Profile.
If the client roams such that its wireless connection moves to a port that is included in a different Connection Profile, a new table search occurs, and the client matches a different row in the Rights Table, based on the combination of the same Identity Profile but a different Connection Profile. This may result in a different set of rights if the Access Policy in the new matching row is different from the Access Policy in the old row.

Note:	To be able to use the new Rights Manager you must have the correct Administration Level set in your User profile in the 700wl Series system. You must have an Administration Level setting of either Console Administrator or Rights Administrator (see the discussion of admin levels on page 3-11).

The configuration of network Authentication and Access Policies is done through the Rights Manager, accessed by clicking the Rights icon on the Navigation Toolbar.

Figure 3-11. The Rights Icon on the Navigation Bar


Within the Rights Manager you may perform any of the following tasks:
•	Creating new Identity Profiles, or modifying ones you have already created
•	Creating new Connection Profiles, or modifying ones you have already created
•	Creating new Access Policies, or modifying existing policies
•	Creating new Authentication Policies, or modifying existing policies
•	Customizing the Logon page (and other associated pages) presented to users whose first network access attempt is an HTTP request.
•	Creating new rows in the Rights Assignment Table
As a part of creating and modifying these profiles and policies, you can also define the following:
•	Users (defined by a username and password) and Network Equipment (defined by a MAC address) to be included in the built-in database. These may be used when defining an Identity Profile.
•	Locations (defined as a set of one or more ports on one or more Access Controllers). These may be used when defining Connection Profiles.
•	Time windows (defined as a range of hours, dates, or days of the week). These may be used when defining Connection Profiles.
•	Allowed Traffic Filters and Redirected Traffic Filters. These may be used when defining Access Policies.
•	HTTP Proxy Filters. These also may be used when defining Access Policies.
From the Rights Manager you can also export the current set of Rights to your local system, import a set of stored Rights from the local system, and download the XML schema that defines the format of the Rights definition file.

Configuring Access Rights–An Overview
To configure rights in the 700wl Series system, you first need to decide how you want to control access to the resources on your network.
 
The New Rights Manager



Figure 3-12. The Rights Manager: Users Page


Step 1. Add Users to the 700wl Series system built-in database. Users are automatically migrated from your 3.1 system to version 4 as part of the upgrade process.

Figure 3-13. The Rights Manager: Identity Profile Page


Step 2. Create Identity Profiles to define who should have access to network resources. You can use Identity Profiles to group sets of users that should have a common set of access rights. You can also use Identity Profiles to assign access rights to network devices such as Access Points.
For example, do you want your Engineers to have a different set of access rights from your Accounting staff? Should Instructors have different access rights than students? Do you have visitors for whom you might want to provide limited access? You create Identity Profiles for each type of user that should have specific types of access, and then define which users belong to each Identity Profile.
 
The New Rights Manager




You add users to the 700wl Series system built-in database and then assign those users to Identity Profiles through the Rights interface, or you can define Identity Profiles that match users based on group or domain information retrieved when the user is authenticated. You can add clients to the 700wl Series system built-in database based on their MAC address as well. These machine clients are termed network equipment; they include the system access points.
If the MAC address data for the network equipment is available from a remote service (for instance from an LDAP server), you can retrieve the data automatically using the MAC Address Retrieval feature of the Rights Manager.
a.	Add users to the built-in database if you don’t plan to have them authenticated by an external authentication service. You can then assign them to Identity Profiles as appropriate.
b.	Add network equipment (such as Access Points) to the built-in database so they can be assigned a set of access rights — for example, to allow the device to be managed over the network.

Figure 3-14. The Rights Manager: Authentication Policy Page


Step 3. Create Authentication Policies to provide different protocols for how a user is authenticated when he connects to the system. An Authentication Policy is an ordered set of Authentication Services (such as a specific LDAP server, RADIUS server, Kerberos server, XML-RPC service or the 700wl Series system built-in database) used to establish the identity of the user. (Authentication Policies are equivalent to Authentication Realms in the old system and are automatically migrated from your 3.1 system as part of the upgrade to version 4.)
 
The New Rights Manager



Figure 3-15. The Rights Manager: Connection Profile Page


Step 4. Create Connection Profiles to differentiate between physical locations where clients can access the system, or adjust access based on the time of day or days of the week, etc., or to differentiate between clients on different VLANs, or a combination of all three. This differentiation can be used to assign different access rights, or to use different authentication methods to verify the identity of the user, or both.
a.	Create locations that include the Access Controller ports that provide connectivity for any specific physical locations that you want to differentiate in terms authentication or access rights.
For example, do you want students to get different access rights while they are in the Library from those they get in a science lab? Do you want clients connecting from your Corporate Visitors Center to be authenticated differently from clients connecting from your manufacturing floor? You can use locations to define Connection Profiles that are unique to a specific physical location—a building, a department, a floor, a conference room.
b.	Create time windows that specify hours of the day, days of the week, and so on, to allow or restrict access during specified times.
For example, if you have temporary workers, or you allow guests, do you want to limit their access to normal working hours during the work week? Do you want to limit access during a particular period, such as during examinations? You can use time windows to define Connection Profiles that allow access only during the specified times.
You create your Connection Profiles by selecting from among the locations and time windows that have been defined (these are automatically migrated over from the wheres and whens of your
3.1 system). In addition, you can specify a VLAN tag to be used in matching clients to the Connection Profile. This allows you to distinguish between different groups of clients for the purposes of authentication or access rights, even though they connect through the same physical locations.
 
The New Rights Manager




Figure 3-16. The Rights Manager: Access Policy Page


Step 5. Create Access Policies that define the sets of access rights you want to grant based on a client’s Identity Profile and Connection Profile.
You can create as many Access Policies as you need. Each row in the Rights table can have a different Access Policy, meaning you can create a different policy for every combination of Identity and Connection Profiles, if needed.
Each Access Policy is a collection of settings that include traffic filters for controlling which packets are allowed into the network, HTTP filters that determine which web sites are accessible or restricted, as well as settings that specify whether encryption is required and of what type, and how IP addressing should be handled.
a.	Create Allowed Traffic Filters and Redirected Traffic Filters as appropriate to allow or restrict access to resources and destinations in your network. A number of filters for common traffic patterns are predefined, but you may want to create additional filters to meet your unique needs.
Create your Access Policies by selecting from among the traffic filters that have been defined, and by specifying other settings such as encryption options, rights timeout values, HTTP proxy filtering, and others.
 
The New Rights Manager



Figure 3-17. The Rights Manager: The Rights Assignment Table Page


Step 6. Add rows to the Rights Assignment Table by combining the Identity Profiles, Connection Profiles, and Access Policies you’ve created. The order of these rows in the table is important, as whenever the 700wl Series system looks for a match it searches the table row by row starting from the top, and stops when it find the first match.

Using the Rights Assignment Table: Examples
To understand how the Rights Assignment Table is used by the 700wl Series system, consider the following examples, based on the Rights Assignment Table shown in Figure 3-18. The first example describes how a normal user (identified by a username and password) gets access rights to the system.
Step 1. A client connects to the 700wl Series system and initially is identified only by its MAC address. This initiates a search of the Rights Assignment Table to match this client to a row in the table, and to assign access rights to the client based on the Access Policy specified by the matching row.
Step 2. Assuming this MAC address is unknown to the 700wl Series system, the client does not match the Identity Profiles in the first four rows, it falls through to the bottom two rows of the table, where it automatically matches the “Any” Identity Profile. If the client accessed the 700wl Series system through a physical location that matches the Connection Profile “Accounting Department,” it matches row 5. If the client connected through any other location, it matches on row 6. In either case the unknown client receives rights based on the “Unauthenticated” Access Policy. This Access Policy provides only the access necessary to log on to the system.
 
The New Rights Manager




Figure 3-18. Rights Assignment Table


Step 3. Given the rights defined by the “Unauthenticated” Access Policy, when the client attempts to access any web page, he/she is instead redirected to the 700wl Series system Logon page. The user can enter a username and password, or select the “Logon as a Guest” option. The logon name and password are passed on for authentication based on the Authentication Policy associated with the Connection Profile. This means that an unknown client that matches on row 5 might be authenticated differently from a client that matches row 6.
If the user enters a logon name and password that is authenticated successfully by the Authentication Policy, the 700wl Series system searches the Rights Assignment Table again using the new identification information. The user now matches one of the Identity Profiles near the top of the table. For example:
•	Suppose the client initially matches row 5, (Identity Profile “Any” and Connection Profile “Accounting”) and his logon information is sent to an external authentication service such as an LDAP server. That service returns the group affiliation “Accounting” as part of the successful authentication. As a result the client matches the Identity Profile “Accounting” as well as Connection Profile “Accounting,” and gets rights based on the “Accounting” Access Policy as specified in row 1.
•	Suppose a client initially matches row 5 and gets successfully authenticated, but the group information returned is NOT “Accounting.” In this case, the client does not match row 1 because it does not match Identity Profile “Accounting.” However, because it has been authenticated, it matches Identity Profile “Authenticated,” and by default matches Connection Profile “Any.” Therefore it gets rights based on row 2.
•	A client that initially matches on row 6, and is successfully authenticated, also gets new rights based on row 2. Due to its Connection Profile it does not match row 1 (and most likely it also does not match the Identity Profile “Accounting”).
•	If the user elects to logon as a Guest, he or she is automatically associated with the “Guest” Identity Profile, matches on row 3 of the table, and receives rights based on the “Guest” Access Policy. Guest users are not considered authenticated by the system, and therefore do not match the “Authenticated” Identity Profile.
 
The New Rights Manager



Note: In this example it is important that the row containing the —Accounting“ Identity Profile and the —Accounting  Department“ Connection Profile be placed before the row containing the
—Authenticated“ Identity Profile and —Any“ Connection Profile. If these two rows were reversed, all authenticated clients would match the —Authenticated“ Identity Profile and —Any“ Connection Profile in the first row–including those who might also match the —Accounting“ Identity Profile and the —Accounting Department“ Connection Profile in the second row. Because the table search stops at the first match, no authenticated clients would ever get as far as the second row to receive access rights from the —Accounting“ Access Policy.

The second example describes how access rights are assigned to clients that are identified only by MAC address, where presenting a user name and password is not appropriate. Network devices such as Access Points fall into this category.
Step 1. A client connects to the 700wl Series system, identified by its MAC address. As in the first example, this initiates a search of the Rights Assignment Table. However, in this case assume that the MAC addresses of all Access Points connected to the various Access Controllers have been added to the built-in database and assigned to the “APs” Identity Profile.
Step 2. In this case the MAC address is known to the system. As in the first example, the client does not match the Identity Profiles in the first three rows, but it does match the “APs” Identity Profile in row 4. This results in the client getting access rights based on the Network Equipment Access Policy. These rights do not send the client through an authentication process, and the client now has the rights it needs.
Like Guests, clients identified only by MAC address are not considered authenticated, and therefore do not match the “Authenticated” Identity Profile. Also, it is important that rows with the “APs” Identity Profile appear in the table before rows that contain the “Any” Identity Profile. Otherwise, the MAC address would match “Any” first, and would never get to the row with the “APs” Identity Profile.

Location	Connection Profile
•	—Everywhere Else“ Location	• —Any“ Connection Profile
Redirects	Redirected Traffic Filters
When	Time Window
Where	Location


Changed Functionality
•	In 3.1, redirects and allows were evaluated based on the alphabetical ordering of their names. Thus naming was important to the order of evaluation of redirects. In version 4 you can order redirect filters by moving them in the list, thus you can call them anything you want.
•	All logs are stored in a single location, accessible via the Administrative Console on the Access Control Server.
 

•	Access Controllers can be named and the name of the Access Controller is used in all displays. You no longer need to remember the IP Address of each Access Controller.

Version 4 Functionality
•	Enhanced SNMP interface. Version 4 MIBs have been added:
—	New 64-bit counter support for high speed interfaces in IF MIB - RFC 2863
—	A HP Systems MIB that provides information on product type, software version, SNMP notifications, and environmental statistics
—	A HP-IF-EXT MIB that provides information for each interface on the number of active clients, roaming events, and the number of current sessions
—	A HP MEMPROC MIB that provides statistics overall product load (both CPU and memory use) 700wl Series system version 4 has added a new SNMP trap:
—	A failover trap—If the secondary Access Control Server becomes the primary Access Control Server (failover) that Access Control Server issues a failover trap.
•	Access Control Server Redundancy (failover): 700wl Series system now supports having a secondary Access Control Server that automatically takes over if the primary Access Control Server fails.
•	Bandwidth management: version 4 provides the ability to limit the bandwidth available to each client. Bandwidth can be limited differently for each Access Policy. Separate limits can be set for upstream and downstream bandwidth.
•	Multiple Administrative Console access levels: version 4 allows for three different levels of access to the Administrative Console.
•	Extended authentication support for VPN clients: 700wl Series system version 4 can interoperate with VPN clients from vendors that require or allow Extended Authentication (XAUTH) to establish a VPN connection. Version 4 also allows VPN clients that use XAUTH to be authenticated to the 700wl Series system during establishment of the VPN connection. Without XAUTH, VPN client users would need to authenticate using the web page after bringing up the VPN connection.
VPN clients that are authenticated to the 700wl Series system using XAUTH are logged off when the VPN connection is terminated.
•	Enhanced VLAN Support: 700wl Series system version 4 supports VLAN tagging. When an Access Controller forwards a DHCP request for a client that is being VLAN tagged going upstream, the Access Controller now tags the DHCP request with the VLAN of the client.
 
FUNCTION MAP:	B
VERSION 3.1 TO VERSION 4


This Appendix is a summary of where in the version 4 Administrative Console to find each feature or function in version 3.1 of the for 700wl Series system. For an overview of how the version 4 Administrative Console is organized and where to find each feature, see “New User Interface” on page 1- 1.
The features are grouped as they were in version 3.1 of the for 700wl Series system. The major functional areas are:

In each section the functions are listed in tabular format. The new location is shown as a series of menu or button selections that take you from any page in the version 4 Administrative Console to the page for that function. For example, the path to get to the setup page for network bridging is shown as: Network  Network Setup  Advanced Setup  Bridging. That is a shorthand means of saying:
Step 1. Click the Network icon on the Navigation bar at the top of the page. (Each path specified always starts with one of the icons on the Navigation bar at the top of the page.)
Step 2. When the new page appears, click on the Network Setup tab.
Step 3. When the new page appears, click on the Advanced Setup tab.
Step 4. When the new page appears, go to the Bridging section of the page.
In some cases you need to select a specific Access Control Server or Access Controller or other item; this takes you to the page of editing the setting for that item. This is shown by putting the item in angle brackets and italics. This means that you click the desired item of that type. In such cases you can also click the New <Item> button to create a new instance of the item, rather than editing the information for an existing instance. For example:
Network  System Components  <Access Control Server>  Enable SSH command line interface. That means:
Step 1. Click the Network icon on the Navigation bar at the top of the page.
Step 2. When the new page appears, click on the System Components tab. (This step is not actually necessary since the Networks functional area starts up showing the System Components page; this step is included for completeness.)
Step 3. Click on the label for the desired Access Control Server.
 

Step 4. When the new page appears, check or uncheck the Enable SSH command line interface checkbox.

Note:	For network and maintenance functions, once you have reached the correct page of the Administrative Console you may still need to select the 700wl Series system component you wish to configure. This is done using the System Components List.
