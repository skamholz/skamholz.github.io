  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  
<dl>
<dt>Q1: What is the call schedule like / how many calls/weekends per month?</dt>
<dd>A1: Night and weekend calls are spread evenly throughout the 3-year period and are in-house. Frequency averages about 1 in 6 nights, but varies somewhat from month to month. Calls should not average to more than 1 in 4 in any given month. The Cardiac ICU rotation at Children’s National is a call-free rotation. The program conforms strictly to the ACGME duty hour guidelines.</dd>
<dt>Q2: Where do we park? Is parking free?</dt>
<dd>A2: Parking in the Georgetown area is not plentiful, but as physicians (fellows, residents, and attendings), you receive free parking in a lot adjacent to the hospital.</dd>
<dt>Q3: Do we get a “food allowance” and a “book allowance?”</dt>
<dd>A3: Fellows receive $360 every six months for meals. These funds can be used at various locations within the hospital and surrounding eateries/restaurants. Fellows receive $1,000 per year for books, conference attendance, etc. Additional funds are available for fellows presenting their research at a regional or national meeting.</dd>
<dt>Q4: What is the <a style="all:revert" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keo2V-64wqY" title="Video introduction">Verstandig Pavillion</a>?</dt>
<dd>A4: MedStar Georgetown’s new state-of-the-art building in the middle of the campus (where fellows used to park!) opened in the fall of 2023. This building now houses the adult ICUs, the operating rooms, and the emergency room in addition to parking and some nice new green spaces. It will also now be the location of our helipad.</dd>
<dt>Q5: What cases are transferred out?</dt>
<dd>A5: Infants are transferred out if they are having an open-heart surgical procedure requiring post-op care in a CICU. In our unit, we DO care for infants with congenital heart disease requiring medical management, cardiac dysfunction requiring medical management, and arrythmias requiring medical management. PDA ligations have also been performed in our NICU. However, when a child requires cardiac catheterization or an open cardiothoracic surgical procedure, the infant is transferred to the CICU at Children’s National Hospital (CNH). These babies can return to Georgetown once they no longer require care in a cardiac ICU. Our fellows rotate through the CICU at CNH for one month in their second year for exposure to post-surgical cardiac care. General surgical procedures, neurosurgical procedures, craniofacial surgeries, and procedures performed by a pediatric otolaryngologist like tracheostomies or supraglottoplasties are performed by our Georgetown subspecialists, and these infants receive post-op care in our NICU. We also have an ECMO program in our NICU, managed by our neonatology team.</dd>
<dt>Q6: What is done for neonatology board preparation?</dt>
<dd>A6: We run a “boot camp” lecture series (including lectures, simulations, and procedure workshops) in July and August. From September through June, fellows participate in an interactive physiology/biostats/ethics board review sessions about 3 times per month. These are led either by a faculty member or by a fellow. Fellows also receive a membership to NeoReviews Plus including review articles and a question bank, and fellows are asked to make a schedule for themselves such that they read a neonatology physiology textbook from cover to cover each year of fellowship.</dd>
<dt>Q7: What is the schedule at the start of fellowship and is there time to study for pediatric board exams?</dt>
<dd>A7: First-year fellows shadow and have frequent “boot camp” activities scheduled in their first three weeks of fellowship. Then they have two 4-week on-service blocks in the NICU (one covering the acute service and one on the step-down service), with back-up available from their more senior fellow colleagues. These service blocks finish in mid-September, after which first-year fellows have a “research” month leading up to the pediatric board exams. During this month they start to think about their fellowship research project, participate in regular Division lectures/conferences, take some overnight calls, and have time to study for boards. Generally, fellows have about 7-10 days call-free prior to the board exams.</dd>
<dt>Q8: What is the vacation/holiday schedule?</dt>
<dd>A8: Fellows are allowed 4 weeks of vacation per year (this translates to 20 weekdays and 8 weekend days). Vacations should be scheduled to account for clinical rotations, on-call schedules, and other colleagues’ vacations. Vacations cannot be taken in July or when on service.</dd>
<dt>Q9: What presentations do fellows give?</dt>
<dd>A9: Each fellow presents at our Division weekly didactic conference on average 3-4 times per year These can be clinical management discussions, research presentations, M&Ms, physiology or pathophysiology presentations, or journal clubs. Fellows also present, together with an OB MFM fellow, at a perinatal conference about once a year. Fellows also have the opportunity to present a NICU core conference for the residents, lectures for the nurses, as well as informal talks for the residents on-service or on call in the NICU. In addition, our fellows become NRP instructors during their first year and teach neonatal resuscitation sessions for residents, nurses, or affiliated hospitals a couple of times per year.</dd>
<dt>Q10: What outside rotations do fellows do?</dt>
<dd>A10: Aside from your rotations at Georgetown, you have:
  <ol>
      <li>A two-week cytogenetics rotation at Quest where you learn about genetic testing and have time to study genetic disorders in your second year. Fellows have didactic lectures and become familiar with the application of several cytogenetic techniques (cell culture, harvesting, G banding, karyotyping, FISH hybridization and analysis, and genetic microarray testing) through observation and participation.</li>
      <li>A three-week rotation at Sibley Memorial Hospital, usually in your second year. This is a high-volume delivery hospital with a special care nursery that is staffed by the same neonatologists who work with you at Georgetown. You continue taking occasional overnight calls at Georgetown, but you do not go to Sibley on your post-call days. This rotation gives fellows exposure to a community neonatology experience, teaching fellows how to manage a busy delivery service, communicate with parents when unanticipated issues arise with the baby, and concurrently provide care for infants in the level 2 Special Care Nursery.</li>
      <li>A four-week rotation at the Cardiac ICU at Children’s National Hospital in your third year. This rotation is daytime only (though the start times are early!) with no call responsibilities either in the CICU or at Georgetown during this time. The goals of the rotation are that fellows become educated in cardiovascular embryology, pre- and post-operative management of the congenital cardiac patients including fluid management, ventilation, and the use of inotropic and chronotropic medications in the context of cardiovascular morbidities. Fellows also gain an understanding of the indications and purposes of surgical interventions used to correct or palliate congenital cardiac malformations and learn about the prognosis and long-term outcomes of congenital cardiac malformations they could encounter in practice.</li>
      <li>A 4-week acute-care rotation at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) 36-bed, Level IIIb full-service critical-care NICU. This rotation occurs during your second year. MWHC offers high-acuity subspecialty care for infants 22 to 23 weeks gestational age and greater with about 3500 deliveries/yr. They manage prenatal consultation and delivery planning as well as postnatal, pre-surgical stabilization for infants with known critical congenital heart disease and complex surgical issues with later transfer to Children’s National Hospital. At MWHC, fellows provide hands-on care without the presence of NP’s, PA’s, residents, or other trainees. The rotation is designed for fellows to run an acute-care team, to participate in consultation/planning for high-risk deliveries and stabilization of these babies, and to have additional procedure exposure including the opportunity to perform circumcisions. You attend MWHC weekly fetal and high-risk conferences as well MGUH Division conferences (remotely). This is a daytime rotation only with a few overnight calls at Georgetown during that month.</li>
  </ol>
</dd>
<dt>Q11: How are fellows evaluated and supported?</dt>
<dd>A11: Fellows are evaluated and supported by several means:
  <ol>
    <li>Verbal feedback should be given halfway through clinical rotations and verbal feedback plus a written evaluation is completed at the end of each attending block in the rotation.</li>
    <li>A few months into fellowship, fellows choose a faculty mentor with whom they feel they have a connection. This person then serves as an extra ear and an “as needed” mentor over the course of fellowship. Fellows have enjoyed the chance to build a special relationship with this one attending. </li>
    <li>Fellows meet individually with the Program Director for a semi-annual review to discuss their progress over the past six months in clinical work, scholarly activity, and teaching; and to set goals for the coming six months.</li>
    <li>The Clinical Competency Committee (CCC), composed of five core faculty members plus additional faculty invitees, evaluates each fellow on their ACGME clinical milestones semi-annually.</li>
    <li>Each fellow has a Scholarship Oversight Committee (SOC) that meets at least semi-annually to oversee and support his/her individual research progress.</li>
  </ol>
</dd>
<dt>Q12: Where is Georgetown University School of Medicine in relation to the hospital?</dt>
<dd>A12: Georgetown University School of Medicine and the Georgetown University undergraduate campus are both on the same campus as MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. This means that all the medical school and university resources, from libraries to research laboratories and athletic facilities to beautiful green spaces, are open for fellows’ use.</dd>
<dt>Q13: Where do fellows choose to live?</dt>
<dd>A13: Some fellows have chosen to live within Washington, DC. Some have lived just over the river in Arlington, VA or Alexandria, VA. Some fellows have lived in areas of Maryland just outside of DC like Silver Spring or Bethesda. Some fellows have lived in Virginia or Maryland but farther outside of DC to be closer to a spouse’s work location or to be closer to family.</dd>
