  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  
<dl>
<dt>Q1:	What is the call schedule like / how many calls/weekends per month?</dt>

<dd>A1:	Night and weekend calls are spread evenly throughout the 3-year period and are in-house. Frequency averages about 1 in 6 nights, but varies somewhat from month to month. Calls should not average to more than 1 in 4 in any given month. The Cardiac ICU rotation at Children’s National is a call-free rotation. The program conforms strictly to the ACGME duty hour guidelines. </dd>

<dt>Q2: What is all of that construction?</dt>

<dd>A2: MedStar Georgetown is currently building a new state-of-the-art building in the middle of the campus (where fellows used to park!) that will house the adult ICUs, the operating rooms, and the emergency room, as well as provide for additional parking and some nice new green spaces. It will be beautiful. Right now, it is a bit of a mess! The good news is that the project is scheduled for completion at the end of 2022 or in 2023, so you will enjoy the benefits of living through its construction!</dd>

<dt>Q3: Where do we park? Is parking free? </dt>

<dd>A3: Parking in the Georgetown area is not plentiful, but as physicians (fellows, residents, and attendings), you receive free parking in the Leavey Center adjacent to the hospital. The nurses and office staff have paid parking that is farther away, some across the bridge from Georgetown in Arlington, VA.</dd>

<dt>Q4:	Do we get a “book allowance?”</dt>

<dd>A4: Fellows receive $1,000 per year for books, conference attendance, etc. Money not used does not carry forward to the next academic year. Additional funds are available for fellows who are presenting their research at a regional or national meeting. </dd>

<dt>Q5: What cases are transferred out?</dt>

<dd>A5: Infants are transferred out if they are having an open-heart surgical procedure requiring post-op care in a CICU. In our unit, we DO care for infants with congenital heart disease requiring medical management, cardiac dysfunction requiring medical management, and arrythmias requiring medical management. PDA ligations are also performed in our NICU. However, when a child requires cardiac catheterization or an open cardiothoracic surgical procedure, the infant is transferred to the CICU at Children’s National. These babies can return to Georgetown once they no longer require care in a cardiac ICU. Our fellows rotate through the CICU at Children’s National for one month in their third year for exposure to post-surgical cardiac care. General surgical procedures, neurosurgical procedures, craniofacial surgeries, and procedures performed by a pediatric otolaryngologist like tracheostomies or supraglottoplasties are performed by our Georgetown subspecialists and these infants are cared for in our NICU. We also care for infants on ECMO in our NICU. The care of these infants is managed by our neonatology team with cannulation and decannulation performed by the surgeons in our NICU.</dd>  

<dt>Q6:	What is done for neonatology board preparation?</dt>

<dd>A6: From September through June (after annual boot camp lectures are completed), fellows participate in an interactive physiology/biostats/ethics board review “flipped classroom” teaching conference 3-4 times per month. These are led by a faculty member who distributes reading materials to help fellows prepare for the discussion. Fellows also receive a membership to NeoReviews Plus including review articles and a question bank, and fellows are asked to make a schedule for themselves such that they read a neonatology physiology textbook from cover to cover each year of fellowship. </dd>

<dt>Q7:	What is the schedule at the start of fellowship and is there time to study for pediatric board exams?</dt>

<dd>A7: First-year fellows shadow and have a focused “boot camp” lecture schedule for their first three weeks of fellowship. They are then on service in the NICU (covering the acute service and then the step-down service or vice versa) for the subsequent 8 weeks, with back-up available from their more senior fellow colleagues. New fellows come off service in mid-September and have a ‘research” month leading up to the pediatric board exams. During this month they start to think about their fellowship research project, participate in regular Division lectures/conferences, take some overnight calls, and can have some time to study for boards. Generally, fellows have about a week call-free prior to the board exams. </dd>

<dt>Q8:	What is the vacation/holiday schedule?</dt>

<dd>A8:	Fellows are allowed 4 weeks of vacation per year (this translates to 20 weekdays and 8 weekend days). Vacations should be coordinated to account for clinical rotations, on-call schedules, and other colleagues’ vacations. Vacations cannot be taken in July and when on service.  </dd>

<dt>Q9:	What presentations do fellows give?</dt>

<dd>A9: Each fellow presents on average 3-4 times per year at the Division of Neonatology Wednesday afternoon teaching conference (clinical management discussion, research presentation, M&M, physiology or pathophysiology presentation, or journal club). Fellows also present a perinatal conference (together with an OB MFM fellow) about once a year, a NICU core conference for the residents (on a basic neonatology topic presented together with a neonatology faculty member) about once a year, lectures for the nurses (especially the new grad nurses) 1-2 times per year, as well as informal talks for the residents on service in the NICU. In addition, fellows should become NRP instructors during their first year and should teaching neonatal resuscitation sessions for residents, nurses, or affiliated hospitals a few times per year.</dd>

<dt>Q10:	What outside rotations do fellows do?</dt>

<dd>A10: Aside from your rotations at Georgetown, you have:
<ol>
<li>A two-week cytogenetics rotation at Quest where you learn about genetic testing and have time to study about genetic disorders. This rotation is usually in your second year. You continue taking occasional overnight calls at Georgetown, but you do not go to Quest on your post-call days. During the course, fellows have didactic lectures and become familiar with the application of several cytogenetic techniques (cell culture, harvesting, G banding, karyotyping, FISH hybridization and analysis, and genetic microarray testing) through observation and participation.</li>
<li>A three-week rotation at Sibley Memorial Hospital, usually in your second year. This is a high-volume delivery hospital with a special care nursery that is staffed by the same neonatologists who work with you at Georgetown. You continue taking occasional overnight calls at Georgetown, but you do not go to Sibley on your post-call days. This rotation gives fellows exposure to a community neonatology experience, teaching fellows how to manage a busy delivery service, communicate with parents when unanticipated issues arise with the baby, and concurrently provide care for infants in the level 2 Special Care Nursery.</li>
<li>A four-week rotation at the Cardiac ICU at Children’s National Medical Center in your third year. This rotation is daytime only (though the start times are early!) with no call responsibilities either in the CICU or at Georgetown during this time. The goals of the rotation are that fellows become educated in cardiovascular embryology, pre- and post-operative management of the congenital cardiac patients, including fluid management, ventilation, nutrition, environment control, use of inotropic and chronotropic medications in the context of cardiovascular morbidities. Fellows also gain an understanding of the indications and purposes of surgical interventions used to correct or palliate congenital cardiac malformations, and appreciate the prognosis and long-term outcomes of congenital cardiac malformations they could encounter in practice.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Q11: How are fellows evaluated and supported?</dt>

<dd>A11: Fellows are evaluated and supported by several means:
<ol>
<li>Verbal feedback should be given halfway through clinical rotations and verbal feedback plus a written evaluation is completed at the end of each attending block in the rotation. </li>
<li>A few months into fellowship, fellows choose a faculty mentor with whom they feel they have a connection. This person then serves as an extra ear and an “as needed” mentor over the course of fellowship. Fellows have enjoyed the chance to build a special relationship with this one attending. </li>
<li>Fellows meet individually with the Program Director for a semi-annual review to discuss their progress over the past six months in clinical work, scholarly activity, and teaching; and to set goals for the coming six months.</li>
<li>The Clinical Competency Committee (CCC), composed of five core faculty members plus additional faculty invitees, evaluates each fellow on their ACGME clinical milestones semi-annually.</li>
<li>Each fellow has a Scholarship Oversight Committee (SOC) that meets at least semi-annually to oversee and support his/her individual research progress.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>Q12: Where is Georgetown University School of Medicine in relation to the hospital?	</dt>

<dd>A12: Georgetown University School of Medicine and the Georgetown University undergraduate campus are both on the same campus as MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. This means that all of the medical school and university resources, from libraries to research laboratories and athletic facilities to beautiful green spaces, are open for fellows’ use.
